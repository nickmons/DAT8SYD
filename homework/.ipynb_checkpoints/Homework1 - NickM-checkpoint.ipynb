    "\n",
    "## Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_8\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown in this notebook and commit it to your repository on github\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "  * What data you will use\n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Course Project 1 - Financial Modelling Backtesting Tool\n",
    "  Overview - Create a model which evaluates (already made) financial models. This tool will also provide data visulaisation of the evaluation and model outcomes.\n",
    "  Data - underlying data will be financial time series data, which I already have/have access to.\n",
    "  Outcome - I want to achieve a model which can provide insightful and visual backtesting information about a financial model it's evaluating.\n",
    "  Modelling tecniques - evaluation of underlying relationship, logistic regression of trade signalling. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Course Project 2 - Economic model for USTs\n",
    "  Overview - Look at large changes in UST yield (>50pts within 6months), and assess if key leading eco variables drove these)\n",
    "  Data - UST (changes in yield), 3-5 key economic variables (change)\n",
    "  Outcome - to gain some predictive power on large changes in yield.\n",
    "  Modelling techniques - multiple linear regression of change in leading eco variables to change in UST yield. Evaluate relatiosnhip\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Git**"
